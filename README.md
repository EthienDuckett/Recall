# Recall
Recall is a terminal based dictionary I made so I can learn linux commands and shell, still in beta
# Disclaimer
I am not to be held accountable for your use of my code

# How to use
Note:
program only works in bash terminal


The program is made entirely in shell and is best operated off of an alias. If you want to use this program I recommend creating a .bash_aliases file in your home
directory and typing   alias recall="bash /home/Downloads/Recall-master/recall.sh"
